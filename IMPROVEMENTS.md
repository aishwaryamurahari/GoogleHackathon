# Route Scoring Algorithm Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the significant improvements made to the Photo-Worthy Routes application's scoring algorithm and time calculation system.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Time Calculation
**Problem**: The original system only used walking mode, which gave unrealistic time estimates (e.g., 2 hours for 5.3 miles).

**Solution**:
- Added support for multiple travel modes: Walking, Cycling, and Driving
- Implemented adjusted duration calculation that includes photo stop time
- Each photo spot adds 5 minutes to the total journey time

**New Time Calculation Formula**:
```
Total Duration = Base Travel Time + (Number of Photo Spots Ã— 5 minutes)
```

### 2. Improved Photo Score Algorithm
**Previous Algorithm**: Simple scoring based on number of spots and average rating.

**New Enhanced Algorithm**:
- **Rating Score** (0-40 points): Based on average rating of photo spots
- **Quantity Score** (0-30 points): Based on number of photo spots found
- **Density Score** (0-20 points): Bonus for high concentration of spots per kilometer
- **Variety Score** (0-10 points): Bonus for different types of photo spots

**Photo Spot Types Recognized**:
- Parks & Gardens
- Museums & Galleries
- Cafes & Restaurants
- Art & Murals
- Landmarks & Monuments

### 3. Multi-Modal Route Generation
**Features**:
- Generates routes for Walking, Cycling, and Driving modes
- Each mode provides different route alternatives
- Routes are sorted by photo score, then by duration for similar scores
- Travel mode is displayed in the UI with appropriate icons

### 4. Enhanced Photo Spot Discovery
**Improvements**:
- Increased search radius from 100m to 200m for better coverage
- Lowered rating threshold from 4.0 to 3.5 for more variety
- Added more keywords for spot discovery
- Dynamic sampling based on route length

### 5. UI Enhancements
**New Features**:
- Travel mode indicators with icons (Footprints, Bike, Car)
- Enhanced route cards showing travel mode
- Updated map component with travel mode display
- Better visual hierarchy for route information

## Technical Implementation

### Route Service Changes
```typescript
// New travel modes support
const travelModes = [
  { mode: google.maps.TravelMode.WALKING, name: 'Walking' },
  { mode: google.maps.TravelMode.BICYCLING, name: 'Cycling' },
  { mode: google.maps.TravelMode.DRIVING, name: 'Driving' }
];

// Enhanced scoring algorithm
private calculateEnhancedPhotoScore(photoSpots: PhotoSpot[], route: google.maps.DirectionsRoute): number {
  const routeDistance = this.parseDistance(route.legs[0].distance?.text || '0 km');
  const avgRating = photoSpots.reduce((sum, spot) => sum + spot.rating, 0) / photoSpots.length;

  const ratingScore = Math.min(40, (avgRating - 3.0) * 20);
  const quantityScore = Math.min(30, photoSpots.length * 3);
  const densityScore = Math.min(20, (photoSpots.length / Math.max(routeDistance, 0.1)) * 5);
  const varietyScore = Math.min(10, new Set(photoSpots.map(spot => this.getSpotType(spot.name))).size * 2);

  return Math.min(100, Math.max(0, Math.round(ratingScore + quantityScore + densityScore + varietyScore)));
}
```

### Type System Updates
```typescript
export interface Route {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  distance: string;
  duration: string;
  photoScore: number;
  photoSpots: PhotoSpot[];
  path: Array<{ lat: number; lng: number }>;
  polyline?: string;
  travelMode?: string; // New field
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Time Estimates**: Users now get accurate time estimates based on their chosen travel mode
2. **Better Route Selection**: Enhanced scoring helps users find truly photo-worthy routes
3. **Travel Mode Flexibility**: Support for different transportation preferences
4. **Improved Discovery**: Better photo spot detection with more variety
5. **Enhanced UX**: Clear visual indicators for travel modes and route quality

## Example Results

**Before**:
- 5.3 miles = 2 hours (walking only)
- Simple photo score based on count and rating

**After**:
- 5.3 miles = 15 minutes (driving) + photo stop time
- 5.3 miles = 45 minutes (cycling) + photo stop time
- 5.3 miles = 2 hours (walking) + photo stop time
- Enhanced scoring considers density, variety, and route quality

## Future Enhancements

1. **Weather Integration**: Adjust route recommendations based on weather conditions
2. **Time of Day**: Consider lighting conditions for photo opportunities
3. **User Preferences**: Allow users to set preferred travel modes and photo spot types
4. **Route Customization**: Let users modify routes to include specific photo spots
5. **Social Features**: Share routes and photo spots with other users
